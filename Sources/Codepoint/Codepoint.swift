/// ```swift
/// let result: UInt32 = #codepoint("∫")
/// print("0x\(String(format:"%X", result))") // prints "0x222B"

/// ```swift
/// let result: UnicodeScalar = UnicodeScalar("∫")
/// print("0x\(String(format:"%X", result.value))")

///
/// In both cases, if the String is composed of more than one scalar or it is empty, the code does not compile.
